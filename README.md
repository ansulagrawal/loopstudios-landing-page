## About The Project

<p>If you're new to React this is a great first challenge. Because the card layout does not change, it is ideal if you have not yet learned how to create responsive layouts.
The main challenge is to build out this cards and top header to and make it look as close to the design as possible.
You can use whatever tools you want to help you complete the challenge. So, if you want to practise something, go ahead.
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- React
- SCSS/SASS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned
Quite simple project for someone new to development! I have fun to work with flexbox for this page and a hover effect for the cards.
## Useful resources

1. <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi">Perfect Pixel</a> - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
